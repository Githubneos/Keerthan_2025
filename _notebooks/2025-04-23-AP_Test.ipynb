    "## üß† How I'm Studying for the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparing for the AP CSP exam requires a balance of code analysis, multiple-choice question practice, and a deep understanding of my CPT project. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how I‚Äôm tackling each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìò 1. **Analyzing Code Segments**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important skills for the CSP exam is being able to **read and interpret code**, especially pseudocode or simplified programming language examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Key Concepts I Review:\n",
    "- **Variables and data types**: What values are stored and how they change.\n",
    "- **Conditionals** (`if`, `else if`, `else`): How decisions are made in code.\n",
    "- **Loops** (`for`, `while`): How repetition is handled.\n",
    "- **Functions**: How procedures are defined and called with parameters.\n",
    "- **Lists and collections**: How data is stored and manipulated.\n",
    "- **Return values vs. printing**: Knowing what a function outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîç How I Practice:\n",
    "- I solve short code analysis questions daily.\n",
    "- I explain code segments to myself or a study partner.\n",
    "- I practice tracing code line-by-line to see how variables change.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù 2. **Answering Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The MC section tests both coding and non-coding topics. To succeed, I study patterns and know how to eliminate wrong answers efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üß© Topics I Focus On:\n",
    "- **Algorithms** and their purposes\n",
    "- **Binary numbers** and data representation\n",
    "- **Internet protocols** like HTTP, TCP/IP, and DNS\n",
    "- **Cybersecurity** and data privacy\n",
    "- **Computing innovations** and their social/ethical impact\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üéØ How I Practice:\n",
    "- I take practice tests from College Board and AP Classroom.\n",
    "- I use Quizlet and AP Prep books to review common question types.\n",
    "- I mark which questions I got wrong and study the concepts behind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üñ•Ô∏è 3. **Mastering the Create Performance Task (CPT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPT is worth 30% of my score and requires me to fully understand the program I created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîç What I Review:\n",
    "- **My program's purpose** and how it solves a problem.\n",
    "- **Input and output** examples.\n",
    "- **Use of abstraction** (my custom function with parameters).\n",
    "- **How I used a list** or another collection to manage complexity.\n",
    "- **How my code shows algorithmic thinking** (selection + iteration).\n",
    "- **Citations** for any images, libraries, or help I used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üìÇ How I Prepare:\n",
    "- I reread my **written responses** (2a‚Äì2d) and make sure I can explain every part of my code.\n",
    "- I practice explaining how my algorithm works step-by-step.\n",
    "- I review my video and check that it clearly shows the function, list, and program behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üóìÔ∏è 4. **My Weekly Study Plan**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Day        | Focus Area                          | Time |\n",
    "|------------|-------------------------------------|------|\n",
    "| Monday     | Code tracing & algorithms           | 1 hr |\n",
    "| Tuesday    | Internet & data review              | 1 hr |\n",
    "| Wednesday  | Practice MCQs + CPT review          | 1 hr |\n",
    "| Thursday   | Practice test & MC strategy         | 1 hr |\n",
    "| Friday     | Study group: review CPT + tough MCs | 1.5 hr |\n",
    "| Saturday   | Full timed practice test            | 2 hr |\n",
    "| Sunday     | Light review + rest                 | 1 hr |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úçÔ∏è Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying for the CSP exam isn‚Äôt just about memorizing ‚Äî it‚Äôs about understanding **why** code works, how computing affects the world, and being able to **defend your work** in the CPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reviewing code, drilling MCQs, and mastering my CPT, I‚Äôm building the skills to do well on both parts of the AP CSP exam.\n"
