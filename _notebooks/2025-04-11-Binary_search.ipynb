    "### âœ… **Free Response Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why is binary search more efficient for large data than linear search?**\n",
    "   Binary search is more efficient because it **divides the search space in half** with each comparison, leading to a time complexity of **O(log n)**. In contrast, linear search examines each element one by one, resulting in **O(n)** time complexity. As the data grows, binary search performs significantly fewer comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What happens if the list isnâ€™t sorted and you try to use binary search?**\n",
    "   Binary search relies on the list being sorted, as it uses the divide-and-conquer approach. If the list isnâ€™t sorted, the search will fail or yield incorrect results because the assumptions made by the algorithm about the relative ordering of elements are violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Could you use binary search in a video game leaderboard or streaming service search bar? Why or why not?**\n",
    "   Yes, binary search could be used in a **video game leaderboard** or **streaming service search bar** if the list of scores or results is sorted. Binary search allows for quick retrieval of information from large datasets, making it ideal for fast searches. However, the list must remain sorted for it to work properly."
