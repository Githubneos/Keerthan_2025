    "Changing the order of coins significantly affected the result‚Äîusing coins from largest to smallest (greedy) used far fewer coins than starting from the smallest. The greedy algorithm performed best when coins were ordered in descending value and matched well with the currency system, but it can fail with unusual coin sets where a non-greedy approach gives a better solution. I learned that while greedy algorithms are fast and often good enough, they aren't always optimal and need to be tested carefully depending on the problem."
