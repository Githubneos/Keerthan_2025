This program allows players to take turns drawing while others guess the word or phrase being illustrated. The goal is to provide an entertaining and interactive way for people to engage in creative gameplay, fostering collaboration, quick thinking, and creativity.\n",

    "My individual feature focuses on implementing the real-time guessing system. This feature enables players to submit guesses while others draw, providing instant feedback on whether the guess is correct. The purpose of this feature is to ensure smooth and engaging gameplay by allowing seamless interaction between players and keeping the game dynamic and competitive."
