    "- **Creating Strings**: \n",
    "  - Use single quotes (`' '`), double quotes (`\" \"`), or backticks (````) for creating strings. \n",
    "  - Backticks (template literals) allow embedding JavaScript expressions using `${expression}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concatenation**: \n",
    "  - Combine strings using the `+` operator or by embedding variables into template literals with `${}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String Interpolation**: \n",
    "  - Template literals with backticks provide a cleaner way to insert variables or expressions directly into a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing**: \n",
    "  - Access individual characters in a string using square brackets (`[]`) or the `.at()` method. \n",
    "  - `at()` also supports negative indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Substrings with `slice()`**: \n",
    "  - Extract parts of a string using `slice(startIndex, endIndex)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Escape Characters**: \n",
    "  - Use `\\` for special characters like:\n",
    "    - `\\n` for new line\n",
    "    - `\\t` for tab\n",
    "    - `\\\\` for backslash\n",
    "    - Unicode characters (e.g., `\\u2731` outputs ✱)\n"

    "### Collaboration and Communication\n",
    "Working with others and collaborating has been a huge part of my growth throughout this project. Before, I was not as good at communicating my ideas or listening to others. But now, I have learned the value of both and that has contributed to my learning and progress in this class. I learned how to share my thoughts clearly, listen to different perspectives, and find solutions together. Collaboration made it easier to solve problems and helped me see the value in everyone’s input. I feel like I’ve become a more effective team member, and it’s taught me how important teamwork and good communication really are."

    "### Diving Deeper into Javascript\n",
    "Through this project, I’ve significantly improved my JavaScript skills. Before, I had a basic understanding of JavaScript, but now I can confidently use variables, loops, and functions. I’ve also learned how to use string manipulation, conditional statements, and arrays more effectively. Working on this project helped me apply these concepts in practical ways, and I feel much more comfortable writing, debugging, and improving my JavaScript code than I did before. I learned a lot through my teammates and other sources and perservered. Before this project, I never had a good grasp on javasscript. I knew a little python, but no javascript, however through this project and this class In was able to get past that and learn to fullest potential."
