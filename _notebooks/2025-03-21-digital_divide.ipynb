    "The digital divide in our community prevents some students from accessing reliable internet and devices for schoolwork. Lower-income families struggle to afford high-speed internet, creating an educational gap. While libraries and community centers offer free Wi-Fi, their limited hours make them an incomplete solution. Schools and organizations should provide loaner laptops, discounted internet plans, and tech support. Expanding broadband infrastructure and advocating for digital equity policies can help bridge this gap."
