    "### Program Design & Development (Big Idea 1.3)\n",
    "- Frontend-Backend Integration:\n",
    "    - Guessing Game: User submits guesses; backend processes correctness.\n",
    "    - Blind Trace Game: User submits drawings; frontend scores similarity and stores results.\n",
    "- Design Documentation: Used flowcharts, UML diagrams, and planning docs for structured development.\n",
    "- Code Style & Documentation: Followed PEP 8, added comments, and maintained modular code.\n",
    "### Debugging & Testing (Big Idea 1.4)\n",
    "- Backend Debugging: Used Postman to test API functionality for guesses and submissions.\n",
    "- Frontend Debugging: Used browser DevTools for UI troubleshooting and error resolution.\n",
    "- Error Handling: Implemented validation for user inputs and API request responses.\n",
    "### Data & Storage (Big Idea 2)\n",
    "- Database (SQLite):\n",
    "    - Guessing Game: Stored guesses, player attempts, and correctness.\n",
    "    - Blind Trace Game: Recorded player scores, submissions, and past game history.\n",
    "- Data Retrieval: Used optimized queries to fetch and display game results efficiently.\n",
    "- Data Security: Ensured data integrity and protected stored records.\n",
    "### Internet & Deployment (Big Idea 4)\n",
    "- Hosting: Deployed using AWS, Nginx, and Docker for scalability and reliability.\n",
    "- RESTful API: Used GET, POST, DELETE requests to manage game interactions.\n",
    "- Security & Authentication: Implemented JWT for user verification and data protection.\n",
