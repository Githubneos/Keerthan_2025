4) A social media site allows users to send messages to each other. A group of researchers gathered user data for the first 10 years of the site’s existence. Some of the data are summarized in the table below, along with some of the company milestones.

Which of the following hypotheses is most consistent with the data in the table?

Answer: The mobile app release did not have any effect on the average number of daily messages sent per user.
Correct Answer: The mobile app release led to users tending to write shorter messages.

5) Which of the following is a true statement about Internet communication?

Answer: Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a digital certificate by a certificate authority.

Correct Answer: Every device connected to the Internet is assigned an Internet protocol (IP) address.

6) A user reads reviews of a popular artist’s new album and then downloads the album from the Web site of a licensed online music seller. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be a consequence of this action?

Answer: Advertisements for the artist’s other albums will be displayed when the user visits a different Web site.

Correct Answer: The user will be in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

7) Byte pair encoding is a data encoding technique. The encoding algorithm looks for pairs of characters that appear in the string more than once and replaces each instance of that pair with a corresponding character that does not appear in the string. The algorithm saves a list containing the mapping of character pairs to their corresponding replacement characters.

For example, the string"THIS_ IS_THE_BEST_WISH" can be encoded as" %#_#_%E_BEST_W#H 

Which of the following statements about byte pair encoding is true?

Answer: Byte pair encoding is an example of a lossy transformation because it discards some of the data in the original string.

Byte pair encoding is an example of a lossless transformation because an encoded string can be restored to its original version.

## Analysis

### Why did I make mistakes?

The errors I committed were due mostly to two fundamental problems: defects in foundational understanding and complications in problem-solving methods. For example, difficult cases include code behavior interpretation-4.B, identification and correction of errors-4.C, and algorithm implementation-2.B, which many times were the result of lack of attention to detail and difficulty managing edge cases. Similarly, errors in questions involving abstraction (3.B, 3.C), computer systems (5.A), and derivation of knowledge from data (5.B) indicate an incomplete understanding of the key concepts and their applications. In addition, difficulties with solution evaluation (1.D) and ethical considerations (5.E) emphasize inadequacies within critical thinking, as well as the capacity to consider the effect of various factors on one another. These mistakes got worse because we were in a hurry when solving problems, misunderstood what was needed, and didn't try to break down tough problems into smaller, easier steps.

### Reflection on Growth

Looking back, it is clear to me how these mistakes represent opportunities for development. In order to fill in the foundational gaps, I will review the most important concepts and practice their application through coding exercises, real-life examples, and challenges in debugging. To perform better problem-solving, I am going to slow down, investigate the tasks more carefully, and practice structured representations like pseudocode and flowcharts. Developing a systematic approach to evaluating solutions will enhance my decision-making and critical analysis. Also, reading through case studies, practicing those tough edge cases, and asking for feedback will build my improvement in understanding and doing those things.
